Build a Revolutionary Decentralized Spreadsheet Application on Bitcoin SV

### Epic ID
EPIC-001

### Epic Owner
Product Team

- HandCash Partnership Team
- Bitcoin SV Community
- Early Adopters
- Privacy Advocates

### Epic Status
In Progress (MVP Complete)

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Millions of users worldwide rely on spreadsheet applications for critical business and personal data management, but current solutions have fundamental flaws:

1. **Data Ownership Crisis**: Users don't truly own their data - it's stored on corporate servers
2. **Privacy Violations**: Companies mine user data for advertising and analytics
3. **Centralized Control**: Single points of failure and censorship
4. **Vendor Lock-in**: Difficult to migrate between platforms
5. **No Audit Trail**: Changes can be made without immutable records

### Opportunity
The blockchain revolution enables a new paradigm for spreadsheet applications:
- True data ownership through cryptographic keys
- Immutable audit trails for compliance
- Decentralized infrastructure with no single point of failure
- Privacy through encryption
- Interoperability through open standards

### Market Size
- Global spreadsheet software market: $7.2B (2024)
- Expected CAGR: 8.2% (2024-2030)
- Target addressable market: 2 billion spreadsheet users
- Initial target: 0.1% market share = 2 million users

## Vision and Strategy

### Product Vision
"Empower users with complete ownership and control of their spreadsheet data through blockchain technology, while delivering a familiar and powerful spreadsheet experience."

### Strategic Goals
1. **Year 1**: Establish as the leading blockchain spreadsheet
2. **Year 2**: Achieve feature parity with Google Sheets
3. **Year 3**: Become the standard for secure, private spreadsheets
4. **Year 5**: IPO or acquisition by major tech company

### Key Differentiators
- First-mover advantage in blockchain spreadsheets
- HandCash integration for seamless authentication
- Military-grade encryption by default
- Open-source and community-driven
- No subscription fees (pay per transaction)
