```

### 3. Development Guidelines

#### Code Standards
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Style**: Prettier configuration (run `npm run format`)
- **Components**: React functional components with hooks
- **State**: Zustand for global state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS utility classes

#### File Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/     # Reusable UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/           # Utilities and services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/           # Next.js app router pages
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/        # Global styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/         # TypeScript type definitions
```

#### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `AudioEngine.tsx`)
- **Utilities**: camelCase (e.g., `formatTime.ts`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_TRACKS`)
- **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase with 'I' prefix for interfaces

### 4. Testing Requirements

All code must include tests:

```typescript
// Example test file: AudioEngine.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { AudioEngine } from './AudioEngine'

describe('AudioEngine', () => {
  it('should initialize with correct default values', () => {
    // Test implementation
  })
  
  it('should handle play/pause correctly', () => {
    // Test implementation
  })
})
```

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- All critical paths must be tested
- Edge cases documented and tested

### 5. Documentation

Update relevant documentation:
- **Code Comments**: JSDoc for public APIs
- **README**: Update if adding new features
- **API Docs**: Document new endpoints
- **User Guide**: Update for user-facing features
