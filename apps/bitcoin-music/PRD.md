# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Bitcoin Music - Decentralized DAW & Music NFT Platform

## Executive Summary

Bitcoin Music is a revolutionary Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) and NFT marketplace that enables musicians to create, produce, tokenize, and monetize their music directly on the Bitcoin SV blockchain. As part of the Bitcoin Apps Suite (BAPS) ecosystem, it introduces the $BMusic token and integrates seamlessly with the Bitcoin-Exchange for trading music assets.

## Problem Statement

### Current Music Industry Pain Points
1. **Centralized Control**: Streaming platforms and labels take 70-90% of revenue
2. **No True Ownership**: Artists don't own their masters or distribution rights
3. **Delayed Payments**: Royalties take months or years to reach artists
4. **Limited Monetization**: Few ways to monetize beyond streams and sales
5. **Expensive Production**: Professional DAW software costs $200-800
6. **Copyright Issues**: No immutable proof of creation date/ownership

### Our Solution
Bitcoin Music solves these problems by:
- Providing a free, professional-grade DAW in the browser
- Enabling direct artist-to-fan transactions with instant payments
- Creating immutable proof of ownership via blockchain timestamps
- Tokenizing music as NFTs with automatic royalty distribution
- Issuing fungible tokens (.ft) for revenue sharing
- Integrating with Bitcoin-Exchange for global marketplace access
