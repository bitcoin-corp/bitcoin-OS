        <h2>What is Bitcoin Writer?</h2>
        <p>
          Bitcoin Writer is a revolutionary document platform that transforms your writing into 
          verifiable blockchain assets. Every keystroke is automatically hashed to the Bitcoin SV 
          blockchain, creating a permanent, timestamped record of your work with cryptographic 
          proof of authorship and version history.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>

            <div className="step-number">1</div>
            <h3>Write Your Document</h3>
            <p>
              Start writing in our editor. As you type, your document is automatically saved 
              and prepared for blockchain storage.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div className="step">
            <div className="step-number">2</div>
            <h3>Automatic Hashing</h3>
            <p>
              When you stop typing, Bitcoin Writer creates a cryptographic hash of your 
              document. Each new version contains the hash of the previous version, 
              creating an unbreakable chain of authenticity.

            <div className="step-number">3</div>
            <h3>Blockchain Storage</h3>
            <p>
              Your document is inscribed onto the Bitcoin SV blockchain using micro-ordinals, 
              making it permanently accessible and verifiable by anyone, forever.
            </p>

            <div className="step-number">4</div>
            <h3>Value Creation</h3>
            <p>
              Your document becomes a unique digital asset (UTXO) that accretes value over 
              time. Each revision adds to its history and worth, like a coin collecting 
              inscriptions.
