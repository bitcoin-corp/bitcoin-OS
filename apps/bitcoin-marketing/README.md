# Bitcoin Marketing - Blockchain Writing App

A decentralized writing application built on Bitcoin SV blockchain with HandCash authentication. Your documents are encrypted and stored on the blockchain, accessible only with your HandCash login.

## Features

- üîí **Encrypted Storage**: All documents are encrypted before being stored on the blockchain
- üîë **HandCash Authentication**: Secure login with your HandCash wallet
- üåê **Access Anywhere**: Your documents are available from any device with your HandCash login
- üíé **Permanent Storage**: Built on Bitcoin SV for immutable document storage
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Rich Editor**: Distraction-free writing with image support
- üíæ **Auto-save**: Automatic saving of your work
- üì± **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- A HandCash wallet and developer account
- HandCash App ID from the [HandCash Developer Dashboard](https://app.handcash.io/developers)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bitcoin-apps-suite/bitcoin-marketing.git
   cd bitcoin-marketing
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and add your HandCash configuration:
   ```
   REACT_APP_HANDCASH_APP_ID=your_handcash_app_id_here
   REACT_APP_HANDCASH_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/handcash/callback
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized build in the `build` folder ready for deployment.

### Deployment

The app can be deployed to any static hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

For Vercel:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

## How It Works

1. **Authentication**: Users sign in with their HandCash wallet using OAuth2 flow
2. **Encryption**: Document content is encrypted using a key derived from the user's HandCash authentication
3. **Storage**: Encrypted documents are stored on the Bitcoin SV blockchain (currently simulated with localStorage in demo mode)
4. **Access**: Only the authenticated user can decrypt and read their documents

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Authentication**: HandCash OAuth2 REST API
- **Encryption**: AES encryption via CryptoJS
- **Storage**: Bitcoin SV blockchain (with BSV library)
- **State Management**: React hooks and local state

## Key Components

- `HandCashAuthService`: Handles OAuth2 authentication with HandCash
- `BlockchainDocumentService`: Manages encrypted document storage and retrieval
- `DocumentEditor`: Rich text editor with blockchain integration
- `Login`: HandCash authentication interface

## Security Features

- Documents are encrypted client-side before storage
- Encryption keys are derived from user authentication tokens
- No plaintext document content ever leaves the user's device unencrypted
- Authentication tokens are securely managed in localStorage

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/Cmd + S**: Save document
- **Ctrl/Cmd + N**: New document
- **F11**: Toggle fullscreen mode
- **Tab**: Insert 4 spaces (indentation)

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject`: Ejects from Create React App (not recommended)

### HandCash Integration

This app integrates with HandCash using:
- HandCash Connect SDK for wallet operations
- HandCash OAuth2 REST API for authentication
- BSV library for blockchain operations

### Environment Variables

- `REACT_APP_HANDCASH_APP_ID`: Your HandCash application ID
- `REACT_APP_HANDCASH_APP_SECRET`: Your HandCash application secret (optional)
- `REACT_APP_HANDCASH_REDIRECT_URL`: OAuth callback URL
