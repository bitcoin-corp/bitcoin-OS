Anna Iversen's <a href="https://annaiversen.substack.com/p/uberfication?r=1cmcgf&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ff9500; text-decoration: underline;">"Uberfication—Entropy Dressed in the Language of the Gig Economy"</a> reads like a lament for a world that's gone — a eulogy for craftsmanship. It's elegant prose, but it's full of misconceptions, errors, and in the end, it misses the point entirely. And since I actually drove Uber in London for seven years and racked up over eleven thousand trips, I think I know what I'm talking about.

It's actually a little too easy for me to tear Anna Iversen's latest article limb from limb for being lazy and convenient — which is a shame, since I shared my vision of Uberfying writing with her in *Bitcoin Marketing* two days ago, and her apparent response was to tear it down immediately, despite the fact that it employs the very technology she supports — Bitcoin — and could revolutionize the writing industry in a way I think is actually pretty cool, and for someone like me, welcome.

And so, while it's difficult to be nice to her, let's at least be generous: she took a swing at *Bitcoin Marketing* as "The Uberfication of Writing." Now it's my turn to dismantle her ideas.

Having worked as an Uber driver, I know how convenient, how easy, how enjoyable it is to work that way. I valued the chance to be valuable — to take people where they needed to go, to be of service — and I valued not having to waste considerable amounts of time and money learning "The Knowledge," which London black cab drivers still do, at a price tag of around £50k over two years. Nice if you can afford it, but frankly, a massive racket run by TfL in an age where GPS is ubiquitous, accurate, and, you know, traceable.

So who exactly is Iversen? She's obviously a Tominaga fan of some description, making allusions to the problem of money, but she seems to have missed the point about tokenized equity and remuneration in the gig economy — which is precisely what *bMarketing* (Bitcoin Marketing) is seeking to address. And while it's straightforward to dismantle her ideas, I'll try to be kind — since Bitcoin is, in some ways, a complex topic — but I do so with reluctance. Every writer chafes at the idea of pulling their punches, and I'm no exception.
