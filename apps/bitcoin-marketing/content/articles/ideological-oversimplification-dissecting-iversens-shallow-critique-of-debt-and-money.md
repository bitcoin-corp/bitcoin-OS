This analysis is not a critique of the technical architecture of Wright's version of Bitcoin, which I agree is the correct protocol for a scalable digital commodity. Rather, it is a critique of Iversen's rhetorical framework in her article <a href="https://annaiversen.substack.com/p/finance-as-the-archetype-of-entropy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #ff9500; text-decoration: underline;">"Finance as the Archetype of Entropy,"</a> which relies on flawed economic analogies and conceptual inconsistencies to brand her favourite tech-stack as "coherent" by misrepresenting the nature of debt in the traditional financial system.

## The Closed-Loop Farmer Fallacy (Failing Basic Economics)

Iversen's primary argument against the "entropic" debt-based system rests on a fundamental arithmetic error, equating all credit with a destructive siphon.

In her analogy, a farmer borrows $100 at 10% interest, resulting in a $110 obligation to repay. She concludes that the extra $10 "does not exist" and must be siphoned from someone else, labor, or nature, rather than 'created'. This argument collapses because it treats the monetary system as a closed loop, ignoring the productive power of credit (leverage).

The reality is that the farmer borrows $100 at 10% to produce $1,000 dollars of crops. Nature is abundant, and the farmer's labour easily outpaces the lender's interest. Where is the new money coming from? Simple answer of course, it's in 'the ground'. So why would Iversen (and others) ignore this most basic principle of finance?

Yes, debt today incurs interest; because the farmer is competing to borrow that money from other productive farmers who might produce more spectacular gains than them. It's a money 'market', so why treat capital as if its' something limitless, when clearly it is limited by the willingness of those who actually have it to lend?

This is the kind of shallow thinking that is constantly repeated by those unwilling or unable to accept the reality of debt, of scarcity, of credit and interest, moreover, it's shallow because it ignores the primary use case of a technology like bitcoin that will be the most abundant of all, 'the tokenisation of debt-based, government issued, fiat money itself'. So let's examine it again:
