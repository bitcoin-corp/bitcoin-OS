Add blockchain querying (D:// protocol) for true decentralization\n2. Implement cross-device sync via blockchain indexing\n3. Add conflict resolution for local vs blockchain versions\n\n**Priority**: 🔴 Critical (Core functionality)  \n**Bounty**: 0.3% (High impact on user experience)\n\n---\n*This resolves the core issue preventing users from accessing their published work.*",
