Adeeb is the guy that I paid to set up the discord. They need to temporarily transfer ownership to for server to set it up. 

Go to server settings.
Click on the Members Tab.
on the top right side, type in "Farrukh" in the search bar.
Click on the three small vertical dots next to My name.
From there, you will see the option to transfer the server ownership.

If you encounter any issues during this process, please do not hesitate to contact me for assistance.
