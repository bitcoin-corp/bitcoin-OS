## üéØ Content Creation Tips

### Subject Line Formula
```
[Emoji] [Day Theme]: [Specific Disaster/Number]
```

Examples:
- ‚úÖ "üö® Mempool Monday: 890 sat/vB Breaks Records"
- ‚úÖ "üí∏ Fee Friday: Someone Paid $2,400 for One Transaction"
- ‚ùå "Newsletter Update" (boring)
- ‚ùå "Hi There!" (spam filter bait)

### Roast Structure
1. **Hook**: Shocking stat or event
2. **Context**: Why it's ridiculous
3. **Comparison**: BSV doing it right
4. **Punchline**: Witty observation

Example:
```
"Lightning Network lost 73 channels this weekend due to high 
on-chain fees. The 'scaling solution' can't afford to scale. 
Meanwhile, BSV processed 50 million transactions for less 
than the cost of opening one Lightning channel. But sure, 
keep calling it 'spam'."
```

## üîß Advanced Features

### A. Add Gemini AI Content Generation

```javascript
// Add to Google Apps Script

  const prompt = `
    Write a satirical paragraph about ${topic} in the style of The Onion.
    Focus on Bitcoin/BTC failures and BSV successes.
    Be funny but factual. Maximum 100 words.
  `;
  
  // Call Gemini API
