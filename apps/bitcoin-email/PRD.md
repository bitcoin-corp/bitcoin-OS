# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Bitcoin Email - Decentralized Email Client

## Executive Summary

Bitcoin Email is an open-source, blockchain-powered email client that revolutionizes digital communication by integrating Bitcoin SV blockchain technology, end-to-end encryption, and native payment capabilities through paymail. It enables users to monetize their inbox, send money via email, and maintain complete ownership of their communications.

## Product Vision

**Mission**: To create the world's first truly decentralized email platform where users own their data, control their privacy, and can monetize their communications.

**Vision**: Become the standard for blockchain-based email communication, driving adoption of the paymail protocol across major email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail) through our open-source implementation.

## Problem Statement

5. **Centralization**: Dependency on single providers creates vulnerabilities

### Our Solution:
- **Blockchain Storage**: Immutable, owned email history
- **Economic Spam Filter**: Charge micropayments to receive emails
- **Native Payments**: Send money as easily as sending an email
