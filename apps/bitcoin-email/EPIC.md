# EPIC: Bitcoin Email - Blockchain-Powered Email Client
## Open Source Paymail Email Platform

### Epic Overview

**Epic Title**: Build Bitcoin Email - The First Open-Source Blockchain Email Client

**Epic Owner**: Product Team

**Target Release**: Q2 2025

**Epic Type**: New Product Development

---

## 🎯 Objective

Create a revolutionary email client that leverages Bitcoin SV blockchain technology to provide users with complete ownership of their communications, native payment capabilities, and end-to-end encryption. The platform will serve as the reference implementation for integrating paymail protocol into existing email services.

## 📋 Background & Context

Traditional email systems suffer from centralization, lack of privacy, spam proliferation, and inability to natively handle payments. Bitcoin Email solves these problems by:

- Storing email hashes on the Bitcoin SV blockchain for immutability
- Enabling micropayments to combat spam
- Providing end-to-end encryption by default
- Allowing users to monetize their inbox
- Creating an open standard for blockchain email

This project builds upon the success of our Bitcoin suite (Writer, Drive, Spreadsheet) and extends the ecosystem with communication capabilities.

## 🎨 Design Specifications

### Visual Identity
- **Primary Color**: Bitcoin Red (#FF4444) - distinguishing from green (Writer), blue (Drive), orange (Spreadsheet)
- **Typography**: SF Pro Display, Helvetica Neue, system fonts
- **Layout**: Familiar three-panel email interface with blockchain enhancements
- **Dark Mode**: Default dark theme (#000000 background) with light mode option

### UI Components (Consistent with Suite)
- macOS-style taskbar (28px height)
- Glass morphism modals with backdrop blur
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-responsive with hamburger navigation
- Accessibility-first design approach

## 👥 User Stories

### Authentication & Onboarding
```
As a new user
I want to sign in with my HandCash wallet
So that I can immediately start using blockchain email without complex setup
```

### Sending Emails
```
As an email sender
I want to compose and send encrypted emails with optional BSV payments
So that I can communicate securely and transfer value simultaneously
```

### Inbox Management
```
As an email recipient
I want to charge micropayments for receiving emails from unknown senders
So that I can monetize my attention and eliminate spam
```

### Developer Integration
```
As a third-party developer
I want to integrate paymail capabilities into my email service
So that my users can benefit from blockchain features without switching platforms
```

### Email Provider Adoption
```
As Gmail/Outlook/Apple Mail
I want to easily adopt the paymail standard using Bitcoin Email's open-source tools
So that our users can access blockchain email features natively
```
