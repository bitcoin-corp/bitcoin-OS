# About Bitcoin Email & The Bitcoin Corporation LTD

## The Real Story

In 2025, frustrated with Bitcoin's descent into unusable "digital gold" with $300 fees and 7 TPS, Richard Boase did something unprecedented: he legally registered "The Bitcoin Corporation LTD" (UK Company No. 16735102).

This isn't a joke. It's real. Check Companies House.

## Why This Matters

By creating a legal entity for Bitcoin governance, we're making a statement:
- **Bitcoin needs leadership** to return to its original vision
- **BTC has failed** as peer-to-peer electronic cash
- **BSV is Bitcoin** - it's the only chain that scales as intended
- **We're building the future** with actual working products

## The Team

### Richard Boase - CEO & Founder
The actual registered director of The Bitcoin Corporation LTD. Yes, legally "the CEO of Bitcoin." Building real products on BSV because someone has to make Bitcoin work again.

### Spamsom Mo - Chief Spam Officer (CSO)
Our satirical alter-ego handling the SPAM newsletter campaign. A parody of Blockstream's Samson Mow, because if they can destroy Bitcoin with small blocks, we can save it with humor.

### Satoshi Nakamoto - Original Architect
We build on Satoshi's actual design: unlimited scaling, micropayments, and peer-to-peer electronic cash. Not the crippled BTC version.

## Our Products

1. **Bitcoin Email** - This repository. Blockchain email with micropayments.
2. **Bitcoin Drive** - Decentralized storage on BSV
3. **Bitcoin Spreadsheets** - On-chain spreadsheet collaboration
4. **$BMAIL Token** - Utility token for the ecosystem

## The Philosophy

We're **open source** but **company-owned**. This means:
- Anyone can use, fork, and modify our code
- We maintain quality and direction
- We can pursue partnerships and funding
- We protect the brand while sharing the technology

Think of it like React (owned by Meta) or VS Code (owned by Microsoft) - corporate backing with open-source benefits.

## Why BSV?

Simple:
- **50,000+ TPS** vs BTC's 7 TPS
- **$0.0001 fees** vs BTC's $50-300
- **Instant transactions** vs 10+ minute confirmations
- **Original Bitcoin** protocol, not modified

## The Humor

Yes, we registered "The Bitcoin Corporation LTD" partly for the meme. But we're also dead serious about fixing Bitcoin. The humor gets attention; the technology delivers value.

## Get Involved

- **Use our products**: They actually work
- **Contribute code**: Open source under Open BSV License
- **Join the SPAM list**: bitcoin-email.vercel.app/spam
- **Build on BSV**: Make Bitcoin useful again
